# Rhodium

Rhodium is an implementation of the OutsideIn(X) algorithm as described in `OutsideIn (X) Modular type inference with local assumptions` by Vytiniotis, D., Jones, S. P., Schrijvers, T., & Sulzmann, M. (2011). 
The implementation is developed as part of a thesis by Joris Burgers, to work with the existing [Helium compiler](https://github.com/Helium4Haskell/helium). 
A formal specification of this work can be found in [`Heuristics-based Type Error Diagnosis for Haskell: The case of GADTs and local reasoning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3462172.3462189) by Burgers, Hage and Serrano.
